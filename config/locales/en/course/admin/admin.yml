            If enabled, the course would show levels and experience points to all students.
            Course staff would be able to configure and award experience points to students.

            Disabling gamification would hide these options, and students would not be able to
            see experience points either. This would also disable the following components -
            Achievements, Levels, Leaderboard and Points Disbursement.
