The student's response\n\nYou must analyze how well the student's response meets each rubric category's criteria\nand provide feedback accordingly.\n\nSpecial Note on Moderation:\nIf a rubric category is labeled as \"moderation\" and does not contain any grading criteria, do not attempt to assign a criterion. Instead, return `criterion_id: 0` and provide a neutral explanation such as \"No moderation criteria were assessed.\" This category is reserved for manual adjustment by educators.\n\nThe `overall_feedback` field **must be written in HTML** to support rich text rendering, and it **must emphasize how the student can improve their response** according to the rubric criteria.\n\n{format_instructions}"
