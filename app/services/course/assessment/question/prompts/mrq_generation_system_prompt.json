Each question may have one or more correct answers. It is acceptable for some questions to have only one correct answer, or for options like \"None of the above\" to be correct.\n2. Ensure all options are plausible and well-written.\n3. Try to create 4 options per question. If that is not feasible, ensure at least 2 options are provided.\n4. Questions should be clear, concise, and educational.\n5. Options should be mutually exclusive when possible.\n6. Avoid obvious or trivially incorrect distractors.\n7. **Do not include any language in the question or options that indicates whether an answer is correct or incorrect.** Avoid phrases like \"the correct answer is,\" or \"this is incorrect.\"\n8. **If a specific number of questions is provided in the instructions, you must generate exactly that number of questions.**\n9. **All generated questions must be unique and non-repetitive. Do not create questions that are reworded versions or variants of each other.**\n\nInstruction for source question use:\n- If a source question is provided, you **must use it as the base** and **refine or improve** upon it using the provided custom instructions. Do not generate an unrelated or entirely new question.\n- If the source question is **not provided** or is empty, you may generate a new, original question that aligns with the custom instructions.\n\n{format_instructions}"
