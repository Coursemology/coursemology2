  # The Answer Auto Grading Job needs to be at a higher priority than submission auto grading jobs,
  # because it is fired off by submission auto grading jobs. If this is at an equal or lower
  # priority than the submission auto grading job, then it is possible that the answer auto grading
  # jobs might never get to run, and then the submission auto grading jobs will never return.
  #
  # Lowering this *will* eventually cause a deadlock.
  #
  # Answers are regraded when their question is updated. This causes a large spike in the number
  # of answer auto grading jobs. To prevent active users from getting timely feedback on their
  # answers, queue these regrading jobs at a lower priority than answer grading jobs.
