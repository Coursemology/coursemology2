  # Bounds the learning rate based on a given min and max learning rate.
  # Min/max overall learning rate refers to how early/late a student is allowed to complete the course.
  #
  # E.g. if max_overall_lr = 2 means a student is allowed to complete a 1-month course over 2 months.
  # However, if the student somehow managed to complete half of the course within the first day, then we can allow him
  # to continue at lr = 4 and still have the student complete the course over 2 months. This method computes the
  # effective limits to preserve the overall min/max lr.
  #
  # NOTE: It is completely possible for negative results (even -infinity), i.e. student needs to go back in time in
  # order to have any hope of completing the course within the limits. The algorithm needs to take care of this.
