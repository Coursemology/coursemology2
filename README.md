Coursemology is an open source gamified learning platform that enables educators to increase student engagement and make learning fun.

## Setting up Coursemology

### System Requirements

1. Ruby (>= 2.5.3)
1. Ruby on Rails
1. PostgreSQL (>= 9.5)
1. ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick (For [MiniMagick](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) - if PDF processing doesn't work for the import of scribing questions, download Ghostscript)
1. Node.js (v14 LTS)
1. Yarn

Coursemology uses [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). In addition, some front-end components use [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/). This [guide](https://gorails.com/setup/) written by the awesome people at GoRails should help you to get started on Ruby on Rails.

### Getting Started

1. We use submodules in the git repo; use this command to update submodules:

   ```sh
   $ git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Download bundler to install dependencies

   ```sh
   $ gem install bundler
   ```

3. Install ruby dependencies

   ```sh
   $ bundle install --without ci:production
   ```

4. Install javascript dependencies

   ```sh
   $ cd client && yarn; cd -
   ```

5. Create and seed the database

   ```sh
   $ bundle exec rake db:setup
   ```

6. Start [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and the development app server

   ```sh
   $ foreman start
   ```

   Or if you are not using foreman:

   ```sh
   # Start the webpack dev server:
   $ cd client && yarn build:development

   # Run this command to compile the assets before running the test suite.
   $ cd client && yarn build:test
   ```

7. You're all set! Simply login with the default username and password:

> Email: `test@example.org`
>
> Password: `Coursemology!`

### Configuration

#### Multi Tenancy

To make sure that multi tenancy works correctly for you, change the default host in `config/application.rb` before deploying:

```ruby
config.x.default_host = 'your_domain.com'
```

#### Opening Reminder Emails

Email reminders for items which are about to start are sent via a cronjob which should be run once an hour. See `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` and `config/schedule.yml` for sample configuration which assumes that the [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) and [Sidekiq-Cron](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron) gems are used.

If you use a different job scheduler, edit those files so your favourite job scheduler invokes the `ConsolidatedItemEmailJob` job once an hour.
