/**
 * The state reconciler for redux-persist that is called to transform the state as deserialized from localstorage to the
 * initial redux state we desire after the restoration.
 *
 * Here, we expect the old deserialized state to contain the old video state slice, and any old session data that
 * was, for one reason or another, not yet sent to the server. We extract the old video state slice and insert it
 * into the old sessions map.
 *
 * The idea is that the video component will attempt to sync the video state slice, together with all session
 * events, with the server when the user closes the window. However, since we should not block a close action, the
 * response from the server may not always arrive in time. In such a case we move the old video state slice into the old
 * session data state slice so that it may be resent to the server. In other words, we try to catch up on session
 * data when a user revisits the video component.
 *
 * @param inboundState The state as deserialized from localstorage
 * @param _ The initial redux state before the other reducers process it (unused)
 * @param reducedState The initial redux state after it passes through the reducers
 * @return {*}
