/**
 * For now, we store a boolean instead of `userId?: number` because there
 * isn't a need to store the `userId` at time of writing. Storing `userId`
 * would mean that we have to also update it when the user masquerades.
 *
 * A boolean is kept here to prevent future developers from trying to use
 * `userId` when its state update isn't fully thought out. If we ever
 * decide to use `userId` more than just an indicator of authentication
 * state, we can `SessionState` and `useAuthState`. These abstractions
 * were made to make it easier to change the authentication implementations.
