 * Entities in the store may be incomplete (i.e. non-detailed or 'mini') or complete
 * (i.e. detailed or 'full'). The parameter `M` denotes the type of incomplete
 * entities, whereas `E` denotes the type of complete entities. If such a distinction
 * between incomplete and complete entities is not necessary, the second parameter can
 * be left out.
 *
 * Note that all interactions with the EntityStore should be performed via helper
