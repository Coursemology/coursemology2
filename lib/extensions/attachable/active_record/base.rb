module Extensions::Attachable::ActiveRecord::Base
  module ClassMethods
    # Declaration for a model having many attachments. This declaration supports two possible ways
    # of association: direct association, or association via a column.
    #
    #   (i) Direct association denotes an object having multiple attachments (eg. Assessement has
    #   multiple files attached to the object itself)
    #
    #   (ii) Association via a column is meant to support the embedding of attachment images
    #   within columns containing HTML markup.
    #
    # For deletion of attachments, it is necessary for the model to implement the
    # +:destroy_attachment+ CanCanCan permission on the +attachable+ object.
    #
    # For (ii), the `has_many_attachments on: :column` declaration provides some additional
    # methods and logic:
    #
    #   1. +column_name_attachment_reference_ids+: Access ids of attachment_references within the
    #   column. This is done by using a HTML parser for the column to locate img tags with the
    #   attribute +data-attachment-reference-id+.
    #
    #   2. +column_name_attachment_references_change+: Similar to +ActiveModel::Dirty+, this
    #   returns an array of old and current attachment_reference_ids. This is to allow custom
    #   callback logic to be implemented by the model. The return value follows the following
    #   shape:
    #   [[Old ids on column], [Current ids on column]]
    #
    #   3. +column_name_for_email+: Returns a rich-text string to be used when sending emails.
    #   This is to allow models to send rich text emails with attachments embedded in them.
    #   This is because emails could be read on a different machine, which might not have
    #   access to the Coursemology server.
    #
    #   4. +update_attachment_references+ (before_save callback): This handles changes in
    #   attachment_references. This includes assocating new attachment_references with the
    #   current object, validating the current set of attachment_references (see
    #   +get_valid_attachment_reference+), and marking removed attachment_references for
    #   destruction (which will be deleted).
    #   This facilitates the WYSIWYG editor to insert images into the content by creating an
    #   attachment_reference first (with +nil+ attachable), then correctly associate the
    #   attachment_reference when the model is saved.
    #
    # @param [Hash] options
    # @option options [Symbol|Array<Symbol>] :on The column associated with attachments, note that
    #   the column type should be string or text.
    #   This can be a symbol or an array of symbols.
    #   An attribute named `column_name_attachment_references` will be defined, you can override it
    #   to customise the way to retrieve the attachment_references for the specific column.
    # @example Has many attachments on a column
    #   has_many_attachments on: :description #=> description contains HTML markup and images
    #   associated with the attachments. Updating description will result in attachments changing.
    #
    #   To change the provided logic, you can override `description_attachment_references_changes`.
