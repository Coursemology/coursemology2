# frozen_string_literal: true
# This is a mix-in that allows jobs to be trackable. Trackable jobs can be queried at /jobs/<id>.
# A client requesting HTML would see a progress bar; a client requesting JSON will get a status
# message. When the job is complete, the trackable job can specify a path to redirect the user to.
#
# To use this mix-in, implement +perform_tracked+ instead of +perform+, with the same arguments.
# If you intend to use +rescue_from+ and you wish for the job to fail, call +rescue_tracked+ with
# the exception.
#
# Jobs are ephemeral; do not expect jobs to remain after a long period of time. Also since jobs
# are uniquely identified only by ID and do not need authentication, do not leak anything
# sensitive from the job.
