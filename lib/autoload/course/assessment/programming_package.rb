# frozen_string_literal: true
# Represents a programming package, containing the tests and submitted code for a given question.
#
# A package has these files at the very minimum:
#
# - +Makefile+: the makefile for building and executing the package. There are at least three
#   targets:
#   - +prepare+: for initialising the environment. This can be used to set up libraries or other
#     modifications to the package.
#   - +compile+: for building the package. For scripting languages, this is a no-op, but <b>must
#     still be defined</b>
#   - +test+: for testing the package. After completing the task, +tests.junit.xml+ must be found
#     in the root directory of the package (beside the +tests/+ directory)
# - +submission/+: where the template code/students' code will be placed. When this package is
#   uploaded by the instructor as part of a question, this directory will contain the templates
#   that will be used when a student first attempts the question. When this package is generated
#   as part of auto grading, then this contains all the student's submitted code.
# - +tests/+: where the tests will be placed. How this set of tests should be run is immaterial,
#   so long it is run when +make test+ is executed by the evaluator.
#
# It can also contain an optional 'solution' folder:
#
#   +solution/+: where syntax correct code is placed. When the package is uploaded by the
#   instructor as part of a question, the contents of this directory will replace the contents of
#   the 'submission' folder. This allows infinite loops or incorrect syntax to be used as templates
#   for the students to fix. It also allows solutions to be kept in the same place as the tests.
#   When this package is generated as part of auto grading, this folder is removed to prevent
#   student code from accessing it.
